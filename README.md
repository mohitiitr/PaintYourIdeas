Attribution :
I a very thankfull to www.flaticon.com and www.freepick.com for providing me with the images to use as my buttons.

My Experience:
It was a full learning experience for me ,i throughly enjoyed the different stages the most valuable moments to me include:
1)when i successfully debugged the canvas + path problem after a hours of frustration.
2)adding the facity of save your drawing as image ,i literaly cried at that time out of happiness.(Becuase i some how destroyed my gradle build files before that and my app was not even compiling)
