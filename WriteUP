Answer to this :
"You have to submit a write up (not more than 200 words) for your project
detailing why you think it is a good idea and how you went about making it."



How i went about :

To be truthfull i picked the second idea from the makers.pdf.I tried to create the cross platform application by researching on
google but i was unsuccesfful ,finally i decided to make an android app on the same idea.
I googled about the topics ,websites that helped me on my way:
   1)developer.android.com 
   2)stackoverflow.com
   3)www.tutorialspoint.com
   4)www.quora.com
   5).. may more which google showed on firt,second,third ,fourth,fifth places.
   
For any topic i read many documentaions ,tutorials and finaly then i wrote my codes.
I had many hours of headache,frustration ,sadness,even expression less facess along with joy when stuff comes into action.
I made two branches dev and master.
I worked on dev,expremented a lot on it ,final code was merged to master branch then pushed to github.
At last i searched the button images ,webistes that helped me:
    1)www.freepick.com
    2)www.flaticon.com
I transformed all my buttons to image buttons ,gave attribution and then tested the app for final.
Then i submitted my idea.
    


How do i think about this idea:
